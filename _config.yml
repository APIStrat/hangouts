    abstract: Welcome to API Strategy and Practice!  This session is designed to help new speakers (and experienced speakers as well) feel comfortable and confident during your presentation.  The idea of presenting at conferences is frequently daunting to non-speakers. When I got started giving talks, I was terrified of being called out on areas I wasn’t an expert in. I finally realized that there are different ways to present information.

        title: Public APIs Are Forever - Taming API Complexity
        abstract: Teams often struggle with balancing the complexity of legacy applications, limited time, and limited resources when designing APIs. The result is often the release of less-than-ideal API design that meets the immediate needs of the client but misses opportunities for longer-term value. This talk will explore a technique for API design thinking and how to apply this technique to your design process to create a clear, well-designed, long-lasting API. The goal of this talk is to discuss how to move API design from endpoints to looking at systems design and domain-driven design (a passion of mine and the techniques I use when helping other businesses design their API). It is a discipline that has worked well for many in this industry, including myself, but seems to have been forgotten or set aside in recent years. Applying these principles will result in a cleaner API design, help identify API product boundaries, and may result in identifying new API product opportunities.
        bio: James is an API consultant with experience in architecting, building, and deploying APIs and cloud native architectures. As an API consultant, he enjoys helping businesses balance great API design and product needs. He also creates and delivers API and cloud native architecture training with the goal of equipping cross-functional teams to integrate their talents toward building first-class APIs for their product or enterprise systems.

        title: Paving the Path to Better OpenStack APIs
        abstract: OpenStack is a land of abundant resources. It's an open source project that provides infrastructure as a service for public and private clouds. These infrastructure resources are logically divided into separate services (e.g. virtual machines via the compute service, files via the object storage service, etc.) and accessible via RESTful APIs. The paths to OpenStack land should lead developers and operations to these resources effortlessly. But all is not so. The paths will take the unwary astray. They twist and turn. They dead end. They lead you into the jaws of waiting dragons. It all adds up to one very frustrating journey. The abundant resources of OpenStack land are accessible but getting there is far more difficult than it should be. To address these difficulties I've helped found the OpenStack API Working Group. Our mission is to improve the developer experience of API users by converging the OpenStack APIs to a consistent and pragmatic RESTful design. Join me and learn how we create API guidelines and reach consensus in an open source community with thousands of contributors. Together we can pave the path to better OpenStack APIs.

        abstract: In the past week, I've heard no fewer than five talks about API documentation—three of them at a tech writing conference and two of them at a developer conference. All five talks acknowledged the central role that documentation plays in developing and marketing a good API. More than that, they discussed the two big challenges to good API docs keeping the docs in sync with the code, and creating clear and compelling high-level overviews.    My proposed talk will look at how tech writers, designers, developers, and PMs can work together on API documentation to make sure both of these critical needs are met. The talk will draw primarily on my past experience documenting several different types of API. In all of these, I've been involved early in the project, sometimes as early as the design phase, where I’ve been able to help bring coherence to both the API itself and to the docs. The talk will also incorporate suggestions from talks by Zdeněk Němec, Jamie Hannaford, and Adam Dangoor at Write The Docs EU.

        abstract: IoT, wearables, network programmability — Many of the newest developer opportunities require hardware and infrastructure. Building a developer community around APIs that are tied to hardware presents some unique challenges. How do you create a fast “time to first hello world” when you need hardware? How do devices and infrastructure affect your events and hackathons? Let’s talk about the challenges and lessons learned in applying DevX best practices to hardware related APIs and how to encourage an API focused product approach for both software and hardware products.

        title: Rapid API Development with Micro Gateways - A Case Study
        abstract: One thing is for sure rapid API building and deployment is a core competency that all modern developers can benefit from. But currently, there are limited options for developers looking to build APIs quickly they can do it themselves, use an MBaaS solution or an API management platform. But all of these options can take a lot of time to understand and can be challenging for developers to scale and manage APIs quickly. To support the Citi Mobile Challenge, Citibank launched a set of virtual APIs to support the event. These APIs gave developers an opportunity to create solutions that could function with existing Citi technology. Citi needed to mimic their production environment, but in a way that developers could still build meaningful mobile apps, without the immediate security and privacy concerns that are present when working with live systems. AnyPresence CTO, Rakesh Rao can speak to this case study. He can explain how Citi was used to quickly create APIs that mimic production APIs and augment them with sample data and responses using API Gateway tool, JustAPIs. Unlike other gateway tools, sandbox environments are a default function of JustAPIs. The JustAPIs server is deployed on IBM SoftLayer cloud infrastructure, and runs behind IBM’s API Management gateway for scaling and throttling as needed.
        bio: Vivek Gupta is the VP of Product Management at AnyPresence, a software platform company that reduces the time and cost of building APIs and enterprise mobile apps.

        title: Is API Management the weak link for the Internet of Things?
        abstract: APIs have become the glue that connects the “things” to the Internet. Companies access (or give access to) these things and the data they generate – both of which are growing at an astounding rate. Yet most of the API management tools in use today were developed up to 20 years ago—when  the numbers of API calls were often measured in hours.<br /><br />The well-known rule that a chain can never be stronger than its weakest link certainly applies to complex and layered Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Even at their most basic, they all have sensors, connectivity and applications. Whereas new technologies have found their place in the IoT universe (RFID, IPv6, big data, RESTful APIs), one critical piece – API management – has been left out, and risks turning into the weakest link.<br /><br />This oversight can pose huge risks for businesses operating in the IoT space. Today, organizations continue to live with outdated performance standards of 200 API calls per second, but most IoT businesses and use cases require much higher throughput—especially in scenarios where API call performance is mission critical.<br /><br />As IoT devices and services continue to grow in usage, so will the number of API calls to the devices. Exceeding the API call limit will slow down services and result in a bad user experience. To prevent users from turning to faster alternatives, performance should be planned from the outset.<br /><br />This presentation will offer tips and advice for future-proofing your IoT investment with high-performance API management—beyond the simple (and expensive) solution of adding more hardware. Explore five core infrastructure upgrades to prepare your business for the Internet of Things–and learn how better performance can bring your IoT implementations a competitive advantage!

        abstract: APIs occupy an interesting place in the technical marketing world even when your company makes an API available to outside developers just as a marketing strategy, you have to market that API. If offering an API is part of your business model, marketing your API is even more critical. This talk will cover different marketing approaches for APIs and how they have played out in the real world (including developer evangelism, hackathons, and documentation-based strategies). We'll also go over how APIs can be useful in marketing your company as a whole.

        title: Content Marketing for APIs
        abstract: We all know APIs need great documentation, but that’s only one piece of a complete content strategy to support your API. You need sample applications, tutorials, blog posts, and other types of content published on a regular basis. And you likely need it from a developer’s perspective, so you can help them learn, trust your company, and hopefully use your API.<br /><br />In this talk you’ll see.<br /><br /><ul><li>How to build a successful blogging engine, including what topics to cover and who will write them.</li><li>How to decide if whitepapers and eBooks make sense for your audience (it depends whether they’re technical).</li><li>How to approach tutorials and sample apps so you’re teaching developers, not marketing to them.</li><li>How to staff your content team, including options for tiny, small, medium, and large companies.</li></up>If content marketing, especially for technical topics, isn’t a natural competency, it’s easy to focus on other things. Unfortunately, that leaves your API lacking some foundational support. There are simple steps to get started now that will pay dividends in the future. API veteran Adam DuVander shares stories of success from stints at developer-focused companies, as well as while Editor of ProgrammableWeb.

        abstract: Personas are a powerful tool for understanding your customer, and often used in marketing, sales or product development. They are equally important for building an external API or breathing new life into a stale API program.<br /><br />In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how powerful personas can be for your API program and show you how to create one, as well as give you tools to measure if you're on the right track.<br /><br />This talk is for you if you want help navigating your organizational challenges with new communication tools. Depending on what environmental context you are in, your API program may live in Engineering, Marketing, or Business Development. It's confusing because it's actually a product that serves all three. Most organizations don't understand that. Using personas can help you guide your organization to understand the value of an API, with proper funding, a dedicated team and real results. Your API program isn’t just a spec, there are real users to think about.

    title: API Strategy - The Next Generation
    abstract: APIs. You build them, test them, ship them, and monitor them. Big whoop. You even have an “API strategy”, but do you know what your real long-term strategy is? Who will be maintaining these systems long-term, years into the future. If you answer “who cares?” then this session is not for you.<br /><br />This session will focus on building teams, people, and minds that can shape our future API strategy such that testing and monitoring becomes less about finding bugs and more about shipping what people actually want in the first place. Disclaimer, there will be no product demos or complicated charts in this talk. We will have a booth for that sort of thing when you’re not at an awesome conference.
    bio: Paul Bruce is a professional nerd. A programmer at 13, of course he loves to code, but really enjoys real conversations with real people about stuff that really matters. Paul currently serves as an API Product Manager at SmartBear, focusing on technical relations and communication.
